Simple Movie Ticket Booking System is based on the concept of booking movie tickets. There’s no login system available for this system, the user can freely use its feature. This mini project contains limited features, but the essential one.

Talking about the features of this Simple system, the user can book movie tickets. For this, the user has to select a movie name, enter customer details such as name and phone number. Then the user has to enter seat number. After this, the booking is done. The user can also change the ticket price and view reservations by entering the admin password. The last feature of this project is about canceling the tickets which can be done by entering the booking id.
